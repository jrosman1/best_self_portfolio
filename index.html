                    <div class="content-block">
                        <p>Hello, my name is Justin Rosman, I am a 3rd year biomedical engineering major at Johns Hopkins with two minors, one in Computer Science and the other in Entrepreneurship and Management…that's how the spiel goes. I've said it dozens or hundreds of times to recruiters, interviewers, and professional connections. And it is real. It is me. I take pride in saying that.</p>
                        
                        <p>In no circumstance I am in do I think I am putting on a face and compromising my authenticity. I wear my interests and commitments on my sleeve. I wear a lot of different hats in life and like to maximize the juggling I do between them. Beyond a dedicated student and engineer, I am a fraternity leader, a socialite, a photographer, a foodie, and a big yapper. My life is a mix of adventures and sidequests, late nights, long conversations, lots of espresso.</p>
                        
                        <p>The activities that fill my time are who I am. I say time, and not free time as I am grateful to have a life where I do not have to do anything. Everything I do, whether it's easy or hard, pleasurable or miserable, I chose. So all my time was once free, and I chose to fill it with commitments that matter to me.</p>
                        
                        <p>What ties all of these activities together is my motivation to impact people, in some way and from any approach. The clearest manifestation of this is my enjoyment of creative work, in particular photography. I like catching small moments my friends don't notice, maybe that I won't even remember. Then, because I shoot on film, when the images come back weeks later it's like lightning in a bottle, the magic of a million moments saved in my portfolio. I like showing them, reminding them how good they looked, who they were once friends with, to recall how they felt back in that time. Underneath everything is the same value. I want people around me to feel seen, included, and taken care of.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="content-block">
                        <h3>What is the purpose of this?</h3>
                        <p>The purpose of this portfolio goes beyond Leadership Theory class. I am a person of chaos, with a million pans on the stove and on a call with 5 times that many people to consult on each one. I do often take time to pause and reflect on my life, and I would like to think I act with intentionality in accordance with my values.</p>
                        
                        <p>However, one key thing I've noticed is that though I may believe I am consistent to myself, perspective is the key to real understanding. I want to take this project as an opportunity to pause, solidify what I think my strengths and values are and how those show up, but then also get the perspective of my close friends and colleagues to see how this may show up for the different people I am impacting from their perspective.</p>
                        
                        <p>This portfolio comes from several pieces. I took personality and conflict assessments. I have interviewed two people who know me very well and asked them to describe to me when I was at my best. I will build my own leadership theory based on myself, backed by research, and end by choosing one concrete behavior of mine to transform.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Reflection matters because it turns the random chaos of my life into patterns.</strong> Once I can know the pattern my life can go from a series of lucky accidents to intentional experiences. I want to understand how I show up so I can choose how to show up.</p>

                    <h4>Why I chose Ryan</h4>
                    <p>The reason I chose Ryan is that he's both my design team leader and a genuinely close friend. I knew him before he took on the leadership role, but once he did, it was clear how naturally he stepped into it. He's caring, he looks out for every person on the team, and he truly wants all of us to succeed. I've always seen him as someone with good judgment, someone thoughtful and steady, someone who doesn't have an unkind bone in his body. Because he's both a friend and the person who leads me day to day, I felt he could give a real, grounded view of when I'm at my best.</p>
                    
                    <h4>When did Ryan see me at my best?</h4>
                    <blockquote>
                        "A specific moment that really speaks out to me is when we had just drafted our new members on our design team. While everyone was extremely excited, the team was definitely scared and unsure what to do to make the freshman feel welcome and a part of this project. Justin stepped up and immediately volunteered to take lead in onboarding the freshman and has done an excellent job doing so. While Justin is constantly an amazing team member and leader within the team, he stepped out his comfort zone to become a leader to newer members. As an extremely busy student with many commitments, I expected a onboarding process that was minimal and simple. However, Justin has made many considerations such as the time commitments of the new students, the current knowledge space, and our team's culture into the onboarding process. Other people responded extremely well and was highly impressed by Justin's leadership and commitment to being a great team member. The freshman are extremely happy in how they are able to get involved in the project early. This stuck in my memory because I have seen a great potential in Justin as a leader and his motivation to step up for the team was shows exactly that. Justin is a strong leader and takes the thoughts of those around him into account and does an excellent job balancing the needs of the team and the members on the team."
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <h4>My Reflection</h4>
                    <p>Hearing Ryan describe that moment honestly meant a lot to me. I remember feeling the mix of excitement and responsibility when we brought in the new members, but I didn't realize how much it stood out to him. To me, stepping up felt natural. I care about our team, and I care about people feeling like they belong, especially when they're walking into something new. What I didn't fully see at the time was how much thought I had put into shaping an onboarding process that respected everyone's time, experience level, and comfort. I was just trying to do right by the team.</p>
                    
                    <p>What struck me most about Ryan's reflection was how he picked up on the intention behind my actions. I tend to jump in, solve problems, and support people because that's where I feel most like myself. Hearing him describe it as leadership helped me see that what I consider instinctive is actually something others recognize and value. It also reminded me that leadership isn't always loud. Sometimes it looks like organizing, paying attention to people's needs, and building a space where new members feel excited instead of intimidated.</p>
                    
                    <p>I walked away from his story feeling proud, but also grounded. It showed me that I can take the energy I bring to friendships or day to day interactions and channel it into something bigger for a team. And if I keep doing that with intention, there's real room for me to grow into an even stronger leader.</p>

                <div class="interview-content">
                    <h4>Why I chose Adriana</h4>
                    <p>I chose my tia Adriana because she's known me literally my whole life. She's been at every birthday, every graduation, and we've always lived close, so we've always been close. On top of that, she's also been my boss. She runs an events company and a flower preservation business, and I've worked for her in both spaces, whether it was helping with logistics, photographing graduations and weddings, or doing hands-on work in the flower shop. So she's seen me as family and as someone she manages. That mix felt valuable because she's watched me grow up and has also seen how I work. I was curious to hear what moments stood out to her as times when I was at my best, given she's had a front row seat for my entire life.</p>
                    
                    <h4>When did Adriana see me at my best?</h4>
                    <blockquote> 
                        "When she talks about seeing me at my best, she always goes back to my high school graduation. I was salutatorian, and she remembers standing there watching me give a speech that wasn't just about me. I made a point to bring everyone into it. I talked about my friends, the history we shared, the people who shaped me, and the idea that we rise together. She said that moment showed how I try to encourage people, listen to them, and help them feel seen. She also said that this wasn't something new. Even as a kid, I had this instinct to look out for people. She told me that when I was five, before I could really grasp what she was going through as a single mom, I sat her down and told her I was worried about her. My big plan was to grow up, buy her a house and a car, and make sure she had the life she deserved. It wasn't about the stuff. It was about wanting her to feel supported and not alone. What stands out to her is that the way I show up for people has always been the same. I don't take sides, I stay open minded, and I try to challenge people in a way that brings out their better self. She says people gravitate toward me because I push them to step up, try new things, and take their dreams seriously. To her, those moments all point to the same thing. I try to make things better wherever I am, and I try to lift the people around me while I do it."
                    </blockquote>

                    
                    <h4>My Reflection</h4>
                    <p>Hearing my tia Adriana talk about those moments honestly made me slow down and think. She's been around for every stage of my life, so when she points to certain memories, it hits a little deeper because she's not guessing. She's pulling from years of watching me grow up and figuring myself out.</p>
                    
                    <p>The graduation story stuck with me because, at the time, I wasn't trying to do anything profound. I just didn't want my speech to be about one person. I wanted it to feel like a moment we all earned together. I didn't think much of it beyond that. But listening to her describe it as this clear example of how I try to build people up made me realize she's been noticing things I never really label in myself.</p>
                    
                    <p>The part about me being five got me in a different way. I barely remember that conversation, but she clearly does. And hearing her talk about it now made me rethink how early some things in me showed up. I didn't understand anything about her situation back then, but I understood enough to care. And that's kind of been a steady theme in my life. I check in. I worry about people. I try to make them feel supported even if I can't fix everything.</p>
                    
                    <p>What she said about me not taking sides and staying open minded felt really true. I don't like making people feel shut down. I like pushing people a little, getting them to actually go after the things they talk about. I never framed any of that as leadership or anything big. It's just how I am day to day. Hearing her put it all together across different points in my life made me see it more clearly.</p>
                    
                    <p>Her perspective made me realize that the way I show up for people isn't something new I developed in college or something I learned in a class. It's just a part of who I am. And having someone who's seen every version of me say that out loud made me appreciate that part of myself more than I usually do.</p>

                        <h4>E - Extraverted</h4>
                        <p>My extraversion manifests in how I get energy from people. Whenever I'm tired or down, a quick conversation, even with someone random, gives me a boost. I love group projects, social events, any situation where I can be part of a social dynamic. One concrete example of this is being elected social chair of my fraternity in my sophomore year for knowing the most people on campus, hardly able to walk between classes without a lot of hello’s.</p>
                        <p>It can create challenges when I talk too early or too often. Sometimes I jump in with my idea before others have time to think. That can unintentionally steer the group in my direction before we have explored alternatives. I also notice that long stretches of solo work feel draining, which matters in engineering where deep focus is important.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="trait">
                        <h4>N - Intuitive</h4>
                        <p>The Intuitive side of my personality shows up in how I think about ideas and patterns. I like imagining how things could be different. I enjoy brainstorming, big picture thinking, and connecting concepts across classes, leadership roles, and personal experiences. On teams, I gravitate toward vision, long term planning, and creative problem solving instead of step by step execution. A concrete example of this is how I am currently trying to create a webapp for my fraternity of an executive dashboard to simplify, unify, and harmonize each member of the executive board.</p>
                        <p>The downside is that I can skip details too quickly. I sometimes assume everyone sees the same pattern I do. In technical work, that can mean I move ahead based on intuition before fully checking assumptions or constraints. I am learning to slow down and pair my intuitive side with structure and data.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="trait">
                        <h4>F - Feeling</h4>
                        <p>The Feeling letter fits how I make decisions. I care deeply about how choices affect people. In leadership roles, I think about morale, inclusion, and how decisions land emotionally. I often notice who seems left out or discouraged and then try to fix that through conversations or small gestures. A concrete example of this comes from the current presidential race in my fraternity. As vice president I am avoiding picking a side, but rather encouraging and arming both candidates to be as successful as possible. I care about both of them and want both to shine. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The challenge is that as a people pleaser, I can sometimes avoid hard conversations in order to not displease anyone. I would rather remain neutral as possible or left things to be assumed and unsaid rather than come into conflict where I will be voicing negative opinions without much construction.</p>

                        <h4>P - Prospecting</h4>
                        <p>Prospecting manifests in my love for adventure and spontaneity. If I am able to do something new or ridiculous I'm always going to choose that. Even if something is harder I'm down for it if it makes a good story. I enjoy last minute ideas, creative changes, and adapting plans based on new information, creating a dynamic team. I adjust quickly to disruptions and keep things moving.  A concrete example of this comes from a recent trip to Boston I took. Instead of ubering back to the hotel at 2 am, I instead suggested we rent bikes and take a 30 minute tear through the city to continue the good vibes of the night. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The downside is that I can overcommit and underestimate how long things take. I sometimes say yes to too many projects because they all sound interesting. Then I have to scramble late in the process. I am learning to build more structure around my schedule and communicate more clearly about what I can realistically do.</p>

                    <div class="trait">
                        <h4>A - Assertive</h4>
                        <p>My assertiveness manifests in my confidence and optimism. I have two quotes that I often come back to. The first inspires confidence and more so persistence in the face of adversity. "Unwavering faith, ultimate belief, depending on the Lord, that's all we got" said by Jameis Winston, quarterback of the Cleveland Browns. I'm no NFL fan, but that quote, and the passion and true faith that Jameis said it with impacted me when I saw a highlight of him on TikTok. What seals this for me is a quote I recently heard at a job fair. "Either you believe you can or you cannot. Either way you are correct," which was said by Henry Ford.</p>
                        <p>This quote inspires my optimistic outlook in the face of everything no matter what. It is easy to walk the path of the cynic, of the nonbeliever. And they may find success. But to look something in the face and believe that it will go well, that a sunrise is at the end of every journey so long as you believe there is and you keep going, will in itself keep you going, will on its own create a self fulfilling prophecy as you reach further and push harder to achieve the dream only you can see. I try to live by these two quotes as much as possible, and try to inspire others to do the same.</p>
                        <p>I recover from mistakes very fast, staying calm in stressful events, on tight deadlines, or huge events. I am careful to never let this slip into overconfidence, though it has at times. I am always checking myself to make sure to be identifying the real risks in any situation, and how to best mitigate or recover from them.</p>

                <div class="content-block">
                    <p>My ENFP-A profile shows up clearly in my leadership and team experiences. In student organizations, I often step into roles where the team needs energy, ideas, and connection. I like building culture, welcoming new members, and turning big ideas into plans. My extraverted and intuitive sides help me see possibilities and get people excited. My feeling and assertive sides help me support others while still moving toward a result.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, these traits create predictable challenges. I can talk too much, drift away from details, overextend myself, and protect relationships at the cost of directness. Knowing this helps me design leadership habits that support my strengths and reduce the downsides.</p>

            <h2 class="section-title">My Leadership Theory</h2>
            
            <div class="theory-card theory-intro">
                <h3>Why this theory exists</h3>
                <p>In many of my teams, the same tension always arises. There is an acknowledgement of the need for honesty, shared leadership, and psychological safety, yet in practice many small moments pass by where no one speaks up. Feedback gets delayed. Concerns stay quiet. People worry about being "too much," "too negative," or "too direct." It is not that we lack big leadership slogans. We lack small, repeatable behaviors that feel doable in busy, real life.</p>
                
                <p>My own personality as an ENFP-A plays into this. I bring energy, optimism, and connection, but I also sometimes avoid hard feedback or uncomfortable truths. I realized that my best moments as a leader often came from tiny acts of courage. I asked one more question. I admitted I was confused. I told someone, kindly, that something was not working. Those small actions shifted the whole dynamic.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="theory-card theory-core">
                <h3>Core Concept: Micro-Bravery Leadership</h3>
                <p class="highlight">Micro-Bravery Leadership says that consistent, small acts of courage from both leaders and team members create psychological safety, learning, and trust more reliably than rare, dramatic moments of heroism.</p>
                
                <p>It focuses on tiny, repeatable behaviors that anyone on a team can practice, not just people with formal titles.</p>
                
                <div class="micro-bravery-examples">
                    <h4>Micro-bravery can be:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Asking a "stupid" question out loud</li>
                        <li>Admitting a mistake early instead of hiding it</li>
                        <li>Giving honest feedback within 24–48 hours instead of sitting on it</li>
                        <li>Naming tension in the room with curiosity instead of blame</li>
                        <li>Inviting the quietest person to speak before stating your own view</li>
                    </ul>

                        <div class="step-number">1</div>
                        <h4>Notice</h4>
                        <p>Team members pay attention to moments that trigger fear, discomfort, confusion, or tension. They notice when someone seems quiet, when there is a gap in understanding, or when an issue keeps getting pushed aside.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="model-step">
                        <div class="step-number">2</div>
                        <h4>Name</h4>
                        <p>Someone names what they notice in simple, neutral language. For example, "I am not sure we all understand this timeline," or "I feel some tension about this decision and I'm not sure why." The act of naming is the first micro-brave step.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="model-step">
                        <div class="step-number">3</div>
                        <h4>Act</h4>
                        <p>The team takes one small action to address what was named. This could be asking a question, clarifying expectations, running a quick check in, or offering specific feedback. The action does not need to be perfect. It just needs to move the situation forward honestly.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="model-step">
                        <div class="step-number">4</div>
                        <h4>Normalize</h4>
                        <p>The leader responds in a way that rewards micro-bravery instead of punishing it. They thank people for speaking up, avoid shaming, and focus on learning. Over time, this makes micro-brave behavior feel normal instead of risky. Teammates also help normalize by supporting each other when someone takes a risk.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p class="model-note">Then the cycle repeats. Each loop builds more trust and makes the next act of micro-bravery easier.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="theory-card theory-research">
                <h3>Research and Evidence</h3>
                <p>Research shows that psychological safety is critical for team learning and performance, and that leadership behaviors shape that climate. Studies on team effectiveness, including Google's Project Aristotle, point to psychological safety as a key factor in high performing teams, more than individual star talent. I wanted a leadership theory that focuses on how everyday, small behaviors from both leaders and followers can build that kind of environment.</p>
                
                <p>Recent work on growth mindset and leadership suggests that leaders who frame challenges as learning opportunities and treat mistakes as data create more resilient and adaptive teams. Research also links everyday leadership behaviors to outcomes like engagement, innovation, and team health, which supports a focus on small daily actions over rare big moments.</p>
                
                <p>Micro-Bravery Leadership builds on this evidence by zooming in on the specific small behaviors that create psychological safety and learning. It translates big ideas like "be supportive" and "promote learning" into concrete steps any team member can practice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="theory-card theory-connections">
                <h3>Connection to existing theories</h3>
                <p>My theory connects to, but differs from, several existing leadership theories:</p>
                
                <div class="theory-comparison">
                    <p><strong>Transformational leadership</strong> focuses on inspiring followers through vision, motivation, and intellectual stimulation. Micro-Bravery Leadership uses some of that inspiration, but focuses more on everyday risk taking and honest communication at all levels.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Servant leadership</strong> emphasizes serving others, humility, and putting followers' needs first. My theory borrows the focus on others, but centers specifically on how serving others includes making space for uncomfortable truths and direct feedback.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Psychological safety frameworks</strong> explain why safety matters and describe stages or conditions for it. Micro-Bravery Leadership offers a behavior level tool. It says "here are the small things you do in a meeting tomorrow that build that safety."</p>
                </div>
                
                <p class="highlight">The original contribution in Micro-Bravery Leadership is the emphasis on micro-actions as the main unit of leadership, not personality traits or rare heroic decisions. It treats leadership as something distributed and practiced in tiny moments, not reserved for people with titles.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="theory-card theory-application">
                <h3>Concrete Steps to Apply Micro-Bravery Leadership</h3>
                <p>A leader or a team member can apply Micro-Bravery through simple repeatable behaviors:</p>
                
                <div class="application-section">
                    <h4>Before Meetings</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Decide one small risk you will take, such as asking a clarifying question or giving credit to someone quieter</li>
                        <li>Plan one open question to invite honest input, like "what are we worried about that we have not said out loud yet?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="application-section">
                    <h4>During Meetings</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use Notice, Name, Act, Normalize loop in real time</li>
                        <li>Invite quieter voices first before sharing your own solution</li>
                        <li>When someone speaks up with a concern, thank them and build on it instead of shutting it down</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <div class="application-section">
                    <h4>After Meetings</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Follow up within 24 to 48 hours with one piece of specific feedback or appreciation</li>
                        <li>Reflect briefly: "when did I see micro-bravery from myself or others today?"</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="theory-card theory-limitations">
                <h3>When This Theory Works and Limitations</h3>
                <p>Micro-Bravery Leadership works best in teams that need creative problem solving, collaboration, and learning over time. It fits student organizations, project teams, early stage companies, and cross functional groups. It is especially helpful when there are power differences or when people feel nervous about speaking up.</p>
                
                <p>The theory has limits. In crisis situations where immediate, decisive action is required, there may be less time for shared micro-bravery. Clear command style leadership can be necessary. In cultures or organizations with very rigid hierarchies and low tolerance for mistakes, micro-bravery may feel too risky at first. People may need structural protection before behavior can shift. It also depends on leaders who are willing to model and reward honesty. Without that, micro-brave acts can be punished instead of normalized.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, micro-bravery does not replace competence or strategy. A team still needs technical skill and clear direction. This theory focuses on how people interact while they pursue those goals.</p>

I have a big personality, a lot of interests, and an instinctive desire to know everyone, support everyone, and be everywhere at once. I get energy from people, ideas, and movement. That part of me is real and good. It is also what stretches me thin.</p>
                
                <p>When I read my ENFP-A assessment, I could almost hear it laughing at me. The description about wanting to connect with everyone, constantly chasing new experiences, and overcommitting because everything sounds exciting felt painfully accurate. My conflict style rankings line up too. I collaborate, I compromise, and I accommodate. That does not just show up in conflicts. It shows up in how I schedule my life. I try to make everyone comfortable, everyone included, everyone happy. The cost sneaks up on me.</p>

                <h3>Why This Behavior Matters Now</h3>
                <p>This matters because my life is only getting faster. The stakes are rising. If I get this wrong now, I will build a life where my identity gets poured into everyone else, and my family and faith only get the leftovers. I do not want that life.</p>
                
                <p>It also matters because I cannot keep pretending that infinite connection is sustainable. I do not have infinite time or emotional bandwidth. The cost of overextension is subtle. I get exhausted. I get scattered. I become physically present but mentally absent. My creativity drops. My patience shortens. My routines fall apart. All the things that make me "me" slowly erode.</p>
                
                <p>Most importantly, if I burn myself out trying to hold up every friendship, I end up missing the relationships that raised me and the practices that keep me centered.</p>

                <h3>Concrete Plan: How I Will Change This</h3>
                <p>I can only fix this if I make the change practical and measurable. Here is the plan:</p>
                
                <div class="plan-item">
                    <h4>Non-negotiable weekly family time</h4>
                    <p>I will schedule one FaceTime or call with my parents or brother every week. It does not matter if it is ten minutes. It just has to happen.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="plan-item">
                    <h4>A monthly family visit or intentional gesture</h4>
                    <p>If I cannot visit, I will send something personal. A photo I took, a note, a letter, something that reminds them they are not an afterthought.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="plan-item">
                    <h4>Church becomes a real part of my schedule, not a leftover</h4>
                    <p>I will attend church twice a month. If I cannot attend in person, I will watch a service online with my phone in another room so I actually focus.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="plan-item">
                    <h4>No more stacking my schedule to please everyone</h4>
                    <p>I will keep one night a week completely unscheduled. No events, no meetings, no shoots, no hangs. Just a reset night. If someone asks to meet, I will say, "I am not free that night," even if technically I am.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="plan-item">
                    <h4>Prioritize depth over breadth</h4>
                    <p>Every Sunday, I will write down the five relationships that matter most to me. My goal for each week is to show up for those five intentionally, not fifty people randomly.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="plan-item">
                    <h4>Say the word "no" with intention</h4>
                    <p>If I am invited to something and my instinct is "I should go so they do not feel bad," that is a no. If it excites me or aligns with my values, that is a yes.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="plan-item">
                    <h4>Track my patterns</h4>
                    <p>At the end of each week, I will ask myself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Did I stick to my family call?</li>
                        <li>Did I attend or watch church?</li>
                        <li>Did I overbook myself?</li>
                        <li>Did I protect my reset night?</li>
                        <li>Who did I neglect?</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="growth-card growth-impact">
                <h3>How This Helps a Real Team</h3>
                <p>This might not sound like a "leadership" behavior, but it is. My teams need me to show up clear, present, energized, and grounded. When I stretch myself across too many social obligations, too many commitments, and too many "sure I can help" moments, I dilute myself.</p>
                
                <p>If I protect my energy, my design team will get a more focused version of me. I will not drag myself into meetings half-burnt from trying to be everywhere the night before. My fraternity exec board will get a leader who thinks straight, not one who is running on fumes. My friends will get the real me, not the stretched thin version.</p>
                
                <p>Most importantly, I will not start resenting the things I love because I never gave myself a chance to breathe.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="growth-card growth-progress">
                <h3>Steps I Have Already Taken</h3>
                <p>I have already started taking small steps. I have skipped a few events that I normally would have forced myself to attend. I called my mom twice last week just to talk, not because something was wrong. I went to church one Sunday even though it would have been easier to sleep in. The world did not collapse. People did not get mad. My life actually felt more balanced.</p>
                
                <p>These small wins showed me that I do not need to change who I am. I do not need to lose my enthusiasm or my social side. I just need to protect the parts of my life that protect me. If I can build this habit now, then future me will not have to relearn it in a much harder context.</p>
